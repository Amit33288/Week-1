# Week-1

Project Title :- 
Identifying Real Disaster Tweets on Social Media

Project Problem Statement :- 
During a crisis, real disaster reports on social media are often buried under a high volume of non-relevant posts using similar keywords. This "noise" makes it difficult for emergency teams to quickly find credible alerts. This project aims to create an automated tool to instantly identify genuine disaster tweets, helping to accelerate response times.

Project Description :- 
During a crisis, social media platforms are filled with vast amounts of information. However, it is challenging for emergency response teams to separate genuine reports of a disaster from metaphorical language (e.g., "this song is fire") or irrelevant posts. This project addresses that problem by developing a text classification model. Using a labeled dataset of tweets, the model will be trained to analyze the content and context of a tweet to accurately determine if it pertains to a real-world disaster. The final goal is to create a simple yet effective tool to aid in faster information gathering for disaster relief efforts.
