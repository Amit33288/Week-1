Project Title :- 
Identifying Real Disaster Tweets on Social Media

Project Summary :- 
This project aims to build a machine learning model to automatically classify tweets as either reporting a real disaster or not. By using Natural Language Processing (NLP), the model will help filter social media noise to find credible information during emergencies.

Project Description :- 
During a crisis, social media platforms are filled with vast amounts of information. However, it is challenging for emergency response teams to separate genuine reports of a disaster from metaphorical language (e.g., "this song is fire") or irrelevant posts. This project addresses that problem by developing a text classification model. Using a labeled dataset of tweets, the model will be trained to analyze the content and context of a tweet to accurately determine if it pertains to a real-world disaster. The final goal is to create a simple yet effective tool to aid in faster information gathering for disaster relief efforts.
